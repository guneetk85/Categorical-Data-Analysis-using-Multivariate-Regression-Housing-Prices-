# Categorical-Data-Analysis-using-Multivariate-Regression-Housing-Prices


The housing prices in the data set is a function of various explanatory variables

price= f( bedrooms+ bathrooms + sqft_living + sqft_lot + floors + yr_built + condition + waterfront + view.....)

sqft_living is the sqft area of the house

sqft_lot is the lot size

price is the housing price in $1000s

waterfront, condition and view are categorical variables

In this project, several regression models were implemented to understand the impact of explanatory variables on housing prices. The following questions were answered:

1. Are houses located at the waterfront expensive than those not located on the waterfront
2. Does the price of houses depend on the number of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms, size of the sqft lot or all of the three factors?
3. Average price of homes with and without waterfront


The following operations were applied:

1. Descriptive statistics
2. Regression
3. tapply and sapply functions
4. Barplots and scatterplots for data visualization
5. Transformation of categorical variables to factor variables
6. t test for statistical significance
7. Data frames to show non-linear relationship

Packages used:
1. Tableone
2. Stargazer
